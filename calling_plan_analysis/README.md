The folder contains files for the calling plan analysis project. 

The goal of the project was to analyse customer behaviour for two different calling plans. Hypotheses were tested to see if the average profits from the two plans are different, and if areas differ in teh average profits they generate. 

T-Test from Python Scipy was used to carry out the hypothesis tests.

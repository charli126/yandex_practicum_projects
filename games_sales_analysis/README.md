The report in this folder presents the analysis of the video games sales data from the online store Ice, spanning over 30 years from 1980 to 2016.

The dataset contains information of the games' platform and genre, the year they were released, their sales in three regions, North America, Europe, and Japan, expert and user review scores, and their ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board) rating.

The goal of the analysis is to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not, which will then allow the store owners to spot potential sales winners and plan advertising campaigns.

The report first shows the steps followed to prepare the data for analysis, then the exploratory data analysis addressing key questions including:

- the pattern in releasing games;
- how sales varied across platforms and how that changes over time;
- how user and professional reviews affect sales;
- how sales of same games varied across platforms; and
- how genres affected sales.
- Following the above analysis, a user profile will be created for each of the three regions. We will take a look at the top five platforms and genres for each region, and how ESRB ratings affect sales in individual regions.

Finally, 2 hypotheses were tested:

- average user ratings of the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same
- average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different

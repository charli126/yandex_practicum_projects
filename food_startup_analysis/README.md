# User behaviour analysis for a food startup
This report in this folder presents the analysis of user behaviour for a food products company. The data was collected from the company app, containing information on user actions over the span of two weeks.

One main goal of the analysis is find out where there might be potential barriers to users making a purchase,by studying the company's sales funnel.

Results of an A/A/B test were also examined, for which the two control groups get the old font of the app, and the experiment group get the new font.

The goal of the analysis for this project is to assess the sales performance of a building-material retailer. The results of the analysis will inform the marketing department of outlet performace and provide insights into what could possibly be done to improve their sales.

The data includes two datasets. The retail dataset contains purchase information including purchase_id, date, item, quantity, customer_id, shop_id, and whether the customer is a member of the loyalty program. The product codes dataset contains information on unit price for each product.

The folder contains a p2p presentation summarizing main analysis results.

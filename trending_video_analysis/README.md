# Trending videos analysis 
There are three files in this folder: the project file in jupyter notebook, in html, and a p2p report. 

The report presents the analysis of the trending videos data and respond to three key questions: 

1. Which video categories trended most often?
2. How were they distributed among regions?
3. What categories were especially popular in the United States? Were there any differences between the categories popular in the US and those popular elsewhere?

The link to dashboard is below (please copy and paste to your browser):

The best view of the dashboard is desktop, enlarged browser window but not full screen. 

The trending_video_report.pdf also provides the link to dashboard on page 1. 

Note: graphs using plotly may not show in Jupyter notebook. To see full visualizations, html can be downloaded and viewed in your local machine.

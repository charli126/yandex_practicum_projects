# Analysis of car advertisements
The goal of the analysis for this project is to examine the pattern of the car advertisements in a range of factors such as price, model year, cylinders, and mileage. 

The data consists of 51525 free advertisements for vehicles on Crankshaft list, posted from 2018-05-01 to 2019-04-19. Exploratory analysis of the data reveals characteristics of cars that tend to be gone quickly, as well as of those that stay on the list longer than most.

# Taxi rides analysis 
This report in this folder draws on the Chicago weather data in November 2017 from the website, and information from a database on taxi rides in Chicago. The exploratory analysis of the data and hypothesis testing are intended to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides.

Three tables have been retrieved and preprocessed the taxi rides database using sql queries. The result of the preprocessing are three datasets:

- a dataset that contains information of the taxi company name and the number of rides each company has November 15-16, 2017;
- a dataset that contains information on Chicago neighborhoods where rides ended, and the average number of rides that ended in each neighborhood in November 2017; and
- a dataset contains information on the rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport.

# Predictive analysis for gym churn rate
This report presents the analysis of data from gym chain: Model Fitness. The goal of the analysis is to provide insights and possible interaction strategies to reduce churn rate among Model Fitness customers. To that end, I have:

- developed machine learning algorithms to predict the probability of churn for each customer in the coming month;
- analyzed the factors that impact churn most;
- drawn up typical user portraits: which group is outstanding and which group should we be concerned with;
- provided recommendations on how to improve customer service; and
- suggested measures to cut churn
